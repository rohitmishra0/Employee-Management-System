# OVERVIEW
On the front index page, we have something which talks about the TSDPL, its journey locations etc. It has a login option on the right most corner. In each of the pages, we have a direct link to the TSDPL home page(Official). <br>
In the login page, we have two different sections. One of HR and the other of employees. Both of these ask for the HR ID/employee ID and the phone number. These sections also contain options to Create a new HR Account or Create a new Employee Account.<br>
This brings us to either of two web pages <br>
HR Dashboard Page, on the left section of the page there is details of HR, Name, ID, Date of Joining, Department. While on the right section there are columns for fetching the Holiday, Quarter, and Medical Book Requests. <br>
Or the Employee Dashboard Page, on the left side is the section for basic details. While on the right side there are options to apply for Holiday, Quarter, and the Medical Book requests. Also the employee has to add a remark/reason for their request. <br>
Both of these dashboards have an option for Logout on the right most top corner which directly brings them to the login page. <br>


# REQUIREMENTS
The project was made on Eclipse IDE Workspace. <br>
Programming languages used were HTML, CSS and Java (for servlet). <br>
It used Tomcat v10.1 server. <br>
Images used were taken from Google and may be copyrighted. <br>
It uses local storage, Oracle Database. <br>


# PROS/Advantages
Minimises interaction between HR and Employee, for small requests/reasons.<br>
Time saving for both the employees and the HR.<br>
Single platform for all of the work of the employee.<br>
Decreases any kind of nepotism chances for any requests, as the request comes as per time it has been created.<br>

# CONS/Disadvantages
The project is made on local storage and hence can’t store a large amount of data as in case of employees in TSDPL.<br>
Little bit difficult to deploy, because in practice there are various kinds of holidays, different quarter areas, and different requests for medical books.<br>
Employees meet HR for many more reasons other than only three of them. So other reasons are also to be taken care of.<br>
Instead of phone no, passwords must be used, so as to retain privacy.<br>



# FUTURE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The database can be shifted from local storage to cloud storage.<br>
More options should be given for employees to handle more requests from Dashboard itself.<br>
HR Dashboard should be more interactive so that everything can be handled from there only.<br>
The project should be shifted to some strong server to handle requests from multiple users at the same time, considering the number of employees in the company.<br>
This platform can also be shifted into “Mobile Application” in iOS and Android making it more easier for the employees to use.<br>
